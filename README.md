##Game Description

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Stones). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
As player reaches to the water his win scores increaser by one, until the player collides with an enemy. Once the player collides with an enemy player win scores reset to zero and game restarts. In the second row users can see the best consecutively wins by a player.
